# Vite, React + TypeScript, TailwindCSS Starter Template

After the release of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) 2.0.0, I try to play with Vite + React + TypeScript and TailwindCSS.

Creating this React project with TailwindCSS is much easier than I thought, and it was faster than other similar tool like create-react-app.

## Installation

```sh
yarn
# or
npm install
```

## Development

```sh
yarn dev
# or
npm dev
```

## Build

```sh
yarn build
# or
npm build
```

Build folder will be located at `./dist`
